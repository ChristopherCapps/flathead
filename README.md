I am learning OCaml by implementing some Z-machine tools, for fun!

I am using OCamlPro for Windows version 4.02.  You can download it from 

https://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/ocpwin/ocpwin-builds/ocpwin64/20160113/

and use the installer:

ocpwin64-20160113-4.02.1+ocp1-full-mingw64.exe

An alternate site, which I have not yet tried, is

http://protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/

which links to installer

http://gallium.inria.fr/~protzenk/caml-installer/ocaml-4.02.3-x86_64-mingw64-installer4-opam.exe

If you try running this code with Unix / Mac / Cygwin / etc versions of OCaml,
I am interested to know if you were successful.  

I will be writing a series of blog articles about this project at
